### Hi there, I'm ryoryosaki ðŸ‘‹


---

I'm an engineer with a solid background in **backend development**, specializing in **Go** and **database systems**. My passion lies in building scalable and reliable systems from the ground up.

Recently, I took on a new challenge and, as a self-taught professional, designed and implemented a complete application infrastructure using **AWS**, **Terraform**, and **GitLab CI/CD**. I enjoy bridging the gap between application logic and infrastructure, ensuring seamless and secure deployments.
